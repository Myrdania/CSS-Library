			<h1>Theme colours</h1>
			<div class="item">
				This theme is a dark theme, made for high contrast, night-work. It is supposed to emulate the look and feel of "Q10" the writing app found over at <a href="http://baara.com/q10/">Joaqu√≠n Bernals website</a>

			<div class="item">
				<h2>.color-primary</h2>

			<div class="item">

			<div class="item">
				<h2>.color-info</h2>
				Info colours are meant to be less scary than warning, and less high-key than success. It is only meant to inform, therefore it should not be high contrast.
